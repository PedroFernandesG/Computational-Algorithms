mutable:
The mutable keyword allows a member of a class to be modified, even if the method accessing it is const. Normally, in a const. method, 
all members of the class should be immutable (not modifiable), but mutable creates an exception to this rule.
In the code, the variable count is marked as mutable, which means that even in methods marked as const, it can be modified.

const:
The const keyword is used to indicate that something cannot be modified. In the case of methods, such as the show() method,
method, this means that the method cannot change the members of the instance it was called on (except for mutable members, as we've already seen).
The use of const also ensures that a method can be called on const objects, i.e. objects that have been declared as constants.

static:
The keyword static in C++ indicates that the variable or function belongs to the class and not to a specific instance.
This means that the value of the static variable is shared between all instances of the class, and not individual to each instance.
In the code, howmany is a static variable, which means that all instances of Date share the same value of howmany. This is useful, for example, to count how many instances of Date there are
